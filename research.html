        <p><strong>Who Should Have a Say? Preferences for Unequal Representation</strong></p>

        <p>Equal representation is at the core of representative democracy, but are citizens actually in favour of it? As heated debates about the influence of certain groups make clear, people may take a variety of stances toward unequal representation (i.e. differential group influence over policy). A citizen may believe, for example, that when it comes to designing integration policies, recent immigrants deserve to have extra influence (due to greater affectedness), less influence (due to vested interests), or the same amount of influence as everyone else. What is more, that same citizen might simultaneously hold very different preferences regarding other groups and policy areas (e.g. bankers with financial legislation, retirees with eldercare). These preferences matter because they shape how politicians behave, both in designing policy and in trying to attract votes – yet we know surprisingly little about them.</p>
         <p>This project therefore investigates attitudes toward the influence of specific groups on issues those groups care about. It does so by employing large-scale, representative panel surveys and innovative survey experiments in the US and the Netherlands, whose  similarities and differences allow us to maximise the insights derived from a two-country comparison. The result will be novel findings regarding (1) the nature and (2) the determinants of preferences for unequal representation. These findings will have key implications for NGOs, scholars, and others seeking to better understand and mitigate majority-minority tensions in democracies. </p>
           
        <p><strong>Universalism and the Welfare State </strong></p>
        <p>How committed are citizens to universalism, redistribution, and the welfare state, and what factors shape their commitment? Through my affiliation with the UNIWEL (universalism and the welfare state) project at Aarhus University, I have investigated various topics related to this theme. This has included papers researching:
        
  <ul>
    <li>The attitudinal effects of the structure of inequality across the income spectrum</li>
    <li>The equality and welfare content of party manifestoes (published in The Journal of European Social Policy)</li>
    <li>The reciprocal relationship between workfare reforms and welfare state preferences</li>
    <li>The motives citizens attribute to those with pro-/anti-redistribution stances</li>
    <li>The attitudinal implications of class identity</li>
  </ul>
        
        <p>Much of this research has been rooted in an original survey we fielded in the US and nine Western European countries. These unique surveys examine social policy preferences from a variety of perspectives, including as they relate to perceptions of fairness, policy trade-offs, inequality, and immigration. In addition, I am currently in the process of developing (along with Kees van Kersbergen, Carsten Jensen, and Alexander Horn) a book manuscript based on these data.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Welfare State Insiders and Outsiders</strong></p>

        <p> Who deserves our collective support? As a key issue in contemporary welfare states,  answers to this question have differed dramatically across time, countries, and policy domains. On the one hand, while many welfare systems have been characterised by significant gaps in coverage, the extent to which governments have extended benefit access varies substantially. On the other, this process has been counterbalanced by efforts to restrict access in order to discourage dependency and limit expenditure. Such policy changes have important ramifications on poverty, inequality, and popular support for the welfare state.</p>
        
        <p> <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/E/bo26267228.html"> <img src="images/book.jpg" alt="Expanding Welfare in an Age of Austerity" width="95" height="142" align="right"></a> My research on this topic has been published in the Journal of European Social Policy and in a newly published book, Expanding Welfare in an Age of Austerity (published by Amsterdam University Press and available through the University of Chicago Press in North America). The book concentrates on the dilemma leftist parties and unions face when confronted with coverage gaps under austerity, as they choose between two problematic options: either extending coverage and retrenching the "good" benefits given to "insiders"; or maintaining the protection, coverage, and benefits of the relatively well-off at the expense of a growing class of excluded "outsiders". It does so by starting from two sets of French-Italian comparisons (complemented by over half a year of field research) and building to both quantitative and qualitative tests of generalisability. I conclude that the role of certain key institutional features has been underemphasised in the literature. These (typically Southern European) factors shape party stances and policy outcomes both directly – through creating organisational incentives – and indirectly – through conditioning public opinion. Overall, the book pushes forward debates about the relationship between social policy preferences and benefit access, while at the same time offering real-world insights into social policy challenges under austerity.</p>
