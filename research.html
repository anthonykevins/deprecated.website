        <p><strong>Who Should Have a Say? Preferences for Unequal Representation - Marie Curie Individual Fellowship</strong></p>

        <p>Equal representation is at the core of representative democracy, but are citizens actually in favour of it? As heated debates about the influence of certain groups make clear, people may take a variety of stances toward unequal representation (i.e. differential group influence over policy). A citizen may believe, for example, that when it comes to designing integration policies, recent immigrants deserve to have extra influence (due to greater affectedness), less influence (due to vested interests), or the same amount of influence as everyone else. What is more, that same citizen might simultaneously hold very different preferences regarding other groups and policy areas (e.g. bankers with financial legislation, retirees with eldercare). These preferences matter because they shape how politicians behave, both in designing policy and in trying to attract votes â€“ yet we know surprisingly little about them.</p>
         <p>This project therefore investigates attitudes toward the influence of specific groups on issues those groups care about. It does so by employing large-scale, representative panel surveys and innovative survey experiments in the US and the Netherlands, whose  similarities and differences allow us to maximise the insights derived from a two-country comparison. The result will be novel findings regarding (1) the nature and (2) the determinants of preferences for unequal representation. These findings will have key implications for NGOs, scholars, and others seeking to better understand and mitigate majority-minority tensions in democracies. </p>
           
        <p><strong>Universalism and the Welfare State </strong></p>
        <p>How committed are citizens to universalism, redistribution, and the welfare state, and what factors shape their commitment? Through my affiliation with the UNIWEL (universalism and the welfare state) project at Aarhus University, I have investigated various topics related to this theme. This has included papers researching:</p> 
        
  <ul>
    <li>The attitudinal effects of the structure of inequality across the income spectrum</li>
    <li>The equality and welfare content of party manifestoes (published in The Journal of European Social Policy)</li>
    <li>The reciprocal relationship between workfare reforms and welfare state preferences</li>
    <li>The motives citizens attribute to those with pro-/anti-redistribution stances</li>
    <li>The attitudinal implications of class identity</li>
  </ul>
        
        <p>Much of this research has been rooted in an original survey we fielded in the US and nine Western European countries. These unique surveys examine social policy preferences from a variety of perspectives, including as they relate to perceptions of fairness, policy trade-offs, inequality, and immigration. In addition, I am currently in the process of developing (along with Kees van Kersbergen, Carsten Jensen, and Alexander Horn) a book manuscript based on these data.</p>
