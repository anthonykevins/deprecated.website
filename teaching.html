		<h2>Teaching</h2> 

        <p>Below you will find a brief overview of my teaching philosophy, experience, and training. For more information, please consult my <a href="http://anthonykevins.github.io/Teaching_Philosophy.pdf">Statement of Teaching Philosophy</a> or my full <a href="http://anthonykevins.github.io/Teaching_Portfolio.pdf">Teaching Portfolio</a>. 
        
		<p><strong>Teaching Philosophy </strong></p>
		<p>My teaching is shaped by the belief that a political science education has the potential to help form not only good political scientists, but also good citizens. In an age in which the formulaic presentation of talking points often passes for quality political discourse, political science can help students move beyond these arguments - ideally creating a lifelong propensity toward higher quality argumentation and research.</p>
		<p>My task as a teacher is to facilitate this development by encouraging active engagement with both the course material and other students. I do so by employing educational best-practices informed by pedagogical research and adapted to student feedback. My course development thus centres around the concept of constructive alignment – that is, a close connection between the intended learning outcomes for a course, the active student learning activities I employ, and the assessment tasks I assign.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Courses Taught</strong></p>
		<p>My teaching experience has included undergraduate and graduate course development and instruction. In formats ranging from small seminars to large lectures involving several hundred students, I have taught both substantive and methodological subject matter.</p>
